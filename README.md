# road-sign-recog
CNN for German Traffic Sign BenchMark Dataset Recognition
A simple convolutional neural network aimed at recognizing road signs of 43 different types from the GTSRB Dataset. Data is representative of real-world images with noise, cropped pictures, and varying lighting. Developed in PyTorch. Achieved a ~98.5% accuracy in training and ~92.5% in testing, with an F1 Score of 0.9251.
